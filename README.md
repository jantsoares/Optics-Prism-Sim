# **Optics Prism Simulation**
A Python-based interactive simulation demonstrating light refraction and reflection (not yet implemented) through a prism using Snell's Law. This project visually represents the behavior of light as it passes through a triangular prism, allowing users to modify key parameters and observe the results in real time. 
Yet to be implemented: 
   1- The reflected rays 
   2- The correct behavior when the light doesn't reach the hollow interior of the hollow prism.
   3- A button in the main program to switch between the solid and hollow cases

---

## **Features**
- Simulate light refraction and reflection (to be implemented) through a solid or hollow prism with customizable parameters.
- Interactive sliders to adjust:
  - Refractive indices of materials (\(n_1\), \(n_2\), and \(n_3\)).
  - Prism wall thickness (\(l\)).
  - Angle of incidence (\(\\theta_1\)).
- Real-time graphical updates showcasing:
  - Incident, refracted, and reflected (to be implemented) rays.
  - Labels indicating calculated angles of refraction and reflection (to be implemented).
- Clear and user-friendly visualization with a built-in reset button.

## **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/optics-prism-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
